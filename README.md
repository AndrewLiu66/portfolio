## Description

This repository contains all the source code of my personal website. I constantly update my website as there are new contents coming up. I included all my project information, working history, as well as my interests within this website.

I have also attached my contact information at the bottom of this website, so feel free to contact me if any questions coming up.

## Context

In the 2nd year of my undergraduate study, I found a huge passion for learning computer science, with a focus on building user-friendly and responsive web interfaces. I believe interfaces are end-points that's cloest to the users. Learning how to program front-end interface allows me to interact and make positive impacts on people easily.

I started by building a website with pure HMTL, CSS, Javascript, then I shifted gears to build more complex interfaces (with backend server) by using React.js. For my personal website, since the majority of the contents are static, there is no need for my audiences to interact with a database. Thus, I decided to build this static website by using bootstrap, an open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. This framework allows me to write code in a cleaner and faster way.

## Development

I used `webpack` to automate the build process and `npm` to download all the necessary javascript library dependencies. The process to run this repository is very straightforward

1. download all necessary npm packages

```
$ npm install
```

2. run the project

```
$ npm run start
```
To build the production files, run the following:
```
$ npm run build
```
The production files will be in the `dist/` folder.

## Deployment
I deployed and set up a customized domain with Github pages since it is one the the fastest way to deploy a static website with an index.html file, and it is totally free
